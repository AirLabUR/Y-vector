# Y-vector
Y-vector: Multiscale Waveform Encoder for Speaker Embedding

Official inference code for Y-vector(https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12951) and unofficial code for wav2spk (https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2020/pdfs/1287.pdf)

Will provide pretrained model (both Y-vector and wav2spk) and inference code soon.
